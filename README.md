# Phantoms

For all my coil (and general RF hardware developments) I've needed to make a variety of phantoms or modify phantoms developed by other groups. I've found them very useful for bench testing and phantom experiments to validate hardware. I'm putting up some of the STL files here. I mostly use Autodesk Inventor so please email me if you would like the .ipt file.

The macaque file is is half and then I mirrored and printed the second half.

The other files currently there are for the anatomical phantom from the Martinos Center resized to fit in the VUIIS Nova coil. Additionally, the skull thickness has been changed to be more accurate. For filling instructions follow their website: http://phantoms.martinos.org/Main_Page
